# Getting Started

## Integrating into your project

Add this to your top level `build.gradle`

```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url  'https://artifacts.bitmovin.com/artifactory/public-releases'
    }
  }
}
```

And these lines to your main project
```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.conviva.sdk:conviva-core-sdk:4.0.20' // <-- conviva sdk
  implementation 'com.bitmovin.analytics:conviva:2.1.1'
}
```

## Examples

The following example create a ConvivaAnalyticsIntegration object and attaches at Bitmovin Native SDK to it

#### Basic Conviva Reporting

```java
// Create your ConvivaConfiguration object
ConvivaConfiguration convivaConfig = new ConvivaConfig(
    "ConvivaExample_BitmovinPlayer",
    "ViewerId1");

// Create ConvivaAnalyticsIntegration
convivaAnalyticsIntegration = new ConvivaAnalyticsIntegration(bitmovinPlayer, "YOUR-CUSTOMER-KEY", getApplicationContext(), convivaConfig);

// Add a new source item
SourceConfig sourceConfig = new SourceConfig("STREAM-URL", SourceType.Dash);
sourceConfig.setTitle("Asset Name"); // Important to set the Asset Name as it's required by Conviva
Source source = Source.create(sourceConfig);

// load source
bitmovinPlayer.load(source);
```

#### Optional Configuration Parameters
```java

convivaConfig.setDebugLoggingEnabled(true);
convivaConfig.setCustomData(customMapOfKeyValuePairs);

```

#### Content Metadata handling

If you want to override some content metadata attributes you can do so by adding the following:

```java
MetadataOverrides metadata = new MetadataOverrides();
metadata.setApplicationName("Bitmovin Android Conviva integration example app");
metadata.setViewerId("awesomeViewerId");
Map<String, String> customInternTags = new HashMap<>();
customInternTags.put("contentType", "Episode");
metadata.setCustom(customInternTags);

// …
// Initialize ConvivaAnalyticsIntegration
// …

convivaAnalyticsIntegration.updateContentMetadata(metadata);
```

Those values will be cleaned up after the session is closed.

#### Consecutive playback
	
If you want to use the same player instance for multiple playback, just load a new source with player.load(…). The integration will close the active session.
	
```java
player.load(…);
```

#### Background handling

If your app stops playback when entering background conviva suggests to end the active session. Since the integration can't know if your app supports background playback this can't be done automatically.

A session can be ended using following method call:

`convivaAnalyticsIntegration.endSession()`
Since the `BitmovinPlayer` automatically pauses the video if no background playback is configured the session creation after the app is in foreground again is handled automatically.

#### Clean up

At end of app instance lifecycle, the convivaAnalyticsIntegration should be released:

```java
@Override
protected void onDestroy() {
    bitmovinPlayerView.onDestroy();
    convivaAnalyticsIntegration.release();
    super.onDestroy();
}
```
